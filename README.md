# minicourse-ajax-project
--------
The Move Planner App is a learning tool I used to experiment and learn about AJAX requests using jQuery's .getJSON and .ajax to make a useful webapp. The initial files used were downloaded from Udacity and is a part of their Frontend Developer Nanodegree course. 


## Features
--------

- Uses Google Streetview to populate the background image with a user specified location
- Pulls up related nyTimes articles based on user specified location
- Pulls up related Wikipedia articles based on user specified city
- Includes .ajax and .getJSON example of pulling information from Wikipedia API
- Error handling is included in both 

## Installation
------------

To see the webapp in action, clone the repository or download the zip file. 

* Click on "index.html" to open the webpage locally. 
* Enter an address and a city and submit
* Review the location's NYT news articles and relevant wikipedia articles with a Google Streetview set as the webpage's background
